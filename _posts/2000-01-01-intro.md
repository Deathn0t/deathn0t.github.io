I am a doctor in computer science on the "**Optimization of Learning Workflows at Large Scale on High-Performance Computing Platforms**". I obtained my Ph.D. in June 2024 under the joint supervision of Prof. <a href="https://guyon.chalearn.org">Isabelle Guyon</a> and Dr. <a href="http://pbalapra.github.io">Prasanna Balaprakash</a>. I have been working on the topics Neural Architecture Search and Hyperparameter optimization since 2018. For a few years now, I have been interested in Uncertainty Quantification in Machine Learning.
